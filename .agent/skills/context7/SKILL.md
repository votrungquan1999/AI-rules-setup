# Context7

Query up-to-date documentation and code examples for any programming library or framework using the Context7 MCP server.

## When to Use

- Looking up API documentation for a specific library
- Finding code examples and usage patterns
- Checking framework-specific patterns and conventions
- Comparing approaches within a library's ecosystem
- Verifying correct usage of library features
- **Prefer this over `@web-search`** when the question is about a specific library or framework

## When NOT to Use

- General programming questions not tied to a specific library
- Searching for blog posts, tutorials, or opinions
- Questions about your own codebase (use file reading tools instead)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Resolve the Library ID

**Always call `resolve-library-id` first** to get the correct Context7-compatible library ID.

```
Tool: mcp_context7_resolve-library-id
Args:
  libraryName: "react"    # The library name
  query: "how to use useEffect cleanup"  # What you're trying to accomplish
```

**Selection criteria** when multiple results are returned:
1. Exact name match (prioritize)
2. Higher Code Snippet count (more examples available)
3. Source reputation: High > Medium > Low
4. Higher Benchmark Score

### Step 2: Query the Documentation

Use the resolved library ID to query specific documentation:

```
Tool: mcp_context7_query-docs
Args:
  libraryId: "/vercel/next.js"  # From Step 1
  query: "how to set up server-side rendering with app router"  # Be specific
```

**Query tips:**
- ✅ Be specific: `"how to use useEffect cleanup function"` 
- ✅ Include context: `"authentication with JWT in Express.js middleware"`
- ❌ Too vague: `"hooks"` or `"auth"`

### Step 3: Apply the Results

1. Read the returned documentation and code examples
2. Adapt examples to fit your project's patterns and conventions
3. Don't blindly copy — adjust for your specific use case
4. If the results aren't helpful, refine your query and try again

## Limits

- **Max 3 calls per question** — if you can't find what you need after 3 Context7 queries, fall back to `@web-search`
- **Max 3 resolve-library-id calls per question** — use the best match available

## Best Practices

- ✅ Always resolve the library ID first before querying
- ✅ Write specific, detailed queries
- ✅ Check the library version matches your project's version
- ✅ Combine multiple query results for comprehensive understanding
- ✅ Fall back to `@web-search` if Context7 doesn't have the library
- ❌ Don't query without resolving the library ID first
- ❌ Don't exceed the per-question call limits
- ❌ Don't include sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in queries

## Related Skills

- `@web-search` - Fall back to web search when Context7 doesn't have the library or for non-library questions
- `@create-implementation-plan` - Use during the research phase of planning
