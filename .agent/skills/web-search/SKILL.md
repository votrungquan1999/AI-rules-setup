# Web Search

Structured approach to searching the web for relevant information during development tasks.

## When to Use

- Researching error messages or stack traces
- Finding documentation for libraries or APIs
- Investigating best practices for a pattern or approach
- Comparing tools, libraries, or frameworks
- Looking up syntax or usage examples
- Answering questions that require current/external knowledge

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define the Search Goal

Before searching, clearly state:
- **What** you need to find (specific question or topic)
- **Why** you need it (what decision or task it supports)
- **What format** will be most useful (tutorial, API reference, example code, comparison)

### Step 2: Craft Effective Queries

Write focused search queries:
- ✅ Include the technology/language: `"TypeScript generics conditional types example"`
- ✅ Include error messages verbatim: `"Cannot find module 'x' error node"`
- ✅ Use domain-specific terms: `"postgresql upsert on conflict do update"`
- ❌ Avoid vague queries: `"how to fix database error"`

**For domain-specific searches**, use the `domain` parameter to prioritize authoritative sources:
- Official docs: `domain: "docs.python.org"`, `domain: "developer.mozilla.org"`
- Stack Overflow: `domain: "stackoverflow.com"`
- GitHub: `domain: "github.com"`

### Step 3: Search and Evaluate

1. Execute the search
2. Read the results critically — prioritize:
   - Official documentation over blog posts
   - Recent content over old posts (check dates)
   - Answers with high community validation
   - Content that matches your specific version/stack
3. If the first search doesn't yield good results, **refine the query** and try again (max 2-3 attempts)

### Step 4: Read and Extract

When a search result looks promising:
1. Use `read_url_content` to read the full page
2. Extract the specific information you need
3. Note the source URL for reference
4. Verify the information against your existing understanding

### Step 5: Apply and Cite

- Apply the findings to your current task
- When sharing findings with the user, include the source URL
- If multiple sources conflict, present both perspectives

## Search Patterns

### Error Investigation
```
1. Search the exact error message
2. Add the technology stack to narrow results
3. Look for GitHub issues if it's library-specific
4. Check Stack Overflow for community solutions
```

### Library/API Research
```
1. Search official docs first (use domain parameter)
2. Look for "getting started" or "quickstart" guides
3. Search for specific API methods or features
4. Find example repositories on GitHub
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ Prefer official documentation over third-party content
- ✅ Verify information is current and version-appropriate
- ✅ Use `@context7` skill for library-specific documentation when available
- ✅ Share sources with the user for transparency
- ❌ Don't trust a single source blindly
- ❌ Don't spend more than 2-3 search attempts on the same question
- ❌ Don't copy code without understanding it

- `@context7` - Use for library-specific documentation queries (faster and more accurate than general web search)
