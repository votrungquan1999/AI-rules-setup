# Code Refactoring

Structured approach to improving code structure without changing behavior, using tests as a safety net.

## Purpose

Refactoring is distinct from feature development — the goal is to improve internal structure while preserving all external behavior. This skill ensures refactoring is safe, incremental, and verifiable.

## When to Use This Skill

- Cleaning up implementation after feature development steps
- Extracting reusable functions or components
- Simplifying complex conditionals or deeply nested code
- Removing duplication across modules
- Improving naming and code organization
- As a periodic checkpoint during `feature-development` workflow

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Refactoring Target

Before touching any code, clearly identify:
- **What** needs refactoring (specific function, class, module)
- **Why** it needs refactoring (duplication, complexity, poor naming, etc.)
- **Which refactoring pattern** applies (see Refactoring Catalog below)

### Step 2: Verify Test Coverage

**CRITICAL: Never refactor without tests.**

1. Check if tests exist for the code you're about to change
2. Run all related tests to confirm they pass — this is your safety baseline
3. **If tests are missing: STOP.** Inform the user that the code lacks test coverage for the area being refactored and that refactoring cannot proceed safely. Ask the user to decide:
   - Write tests first (use `@tdd-design` or `@bdd-design`), then resume refactoring
   - Proceed anyway (accepting the risk)
   - Skip this refactoring

### Step 3: Apply the Refactoring

Apply **one refactoring at a time**. Do not combine multiple refactorings in a single step.

1. Make the structural change
2. Run tests immediately
3. If tests pass → commit or move to next refactoring
4. If tests fail → revert and reassess

### Step 4: Verify Behavior Preserved

1. Run the full related test suite
2. Run linting to check for code quality issues
3. Confirm no behavioral change — only structural improvement

## Refactoring Catalog

### Extract Function
**When:** A code fragment can be grouped together and given a descriptive name.
```
// Before
function processOrder(order) {
  // ...validate order
  if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("Order must have items");
  }
  if (!order.customer) {
    throw new Error("Order must have customer");
  }
  // ...process payment
}

// After
function validateOrder(order) {
  if (!order.items || order.items.length === 0) {
    throw new Error("Order must have items");
  }
  if (!order.customer) {
    throw new Error("Order must have customer");
  }
}

function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  // ...process payment
}
```

### Rename (Variable, Function, Class)
**When:** A name doesn't clearly communicate intent.
- Choose names that describe **what**, not **how**
- Use domain language consistent with the codebase

### Inline
**When:** A function body is as clear as its name, or a variable is used only once and adds no clarity.

### Simplify Conditional
**When:** Complex nested if/else or switch statements obscure logic.
- Use guard clauses for early returns
- Extract conditional logic into descriptive boolean functions
- Replace nested conditionals with flat, readable structure

### Move Function/Class
**When:** A function or class belongs more naturally in another module.
- Move closer to where it's used most
- Group related functionality together

### Remove Duplication
**When:** Similar code appears in multiple places.
- Extract shared logic into a utility or helper
- Use composition over copy-paste

## Best Practices

- ✅ One refactoring at a time — keep changes atomic
- ✅ Run tests after every change
- ✅ Commit after each successful refactoring (or after a logical group)
- ✅ Preserve public interfaces when possible
- ✅ Use IDE rename/move tools when available for safety
- ❌ Don't refactor and add features simultaneously
- ❌ Don't refactor without test coverage
- ❌ Don't combine multiple unrelated refactorings

## Related Skills

- `@tdd-design` - Write tests first if coverage is missing before refactoring
- `@test-quality-reviewer` - Review test quality after refactoring to ensure tests still follow best practices
- `@bdd-design` - Use BDD scenarios to verify behavior preservation at a higher level
