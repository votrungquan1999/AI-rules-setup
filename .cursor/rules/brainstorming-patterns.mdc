# Brainstorming with AI Agents

## 1. Problem Definition Phase

- Create a markdown file for the brainstorming document.
- CLEARLY state the problem statement at the top of the brainstorming document
- Define hypotheses and potential solutions
- List constraints and requirements
- Identify stakeholders and impact areas
- Document the current state and context
- Sections in the brainstorm document can refer to each other using markdown links to make it easier to navigate.

## 2. Clarification Through Questions

- AI MUST ask clarifying questions before generating ideas since it can go in the wrong direction and become useless.
- AI MUST ask clarifying questions before proceeding with brainstorming
- Questions should cover: scope, constraints, goals, success criteria, context
- Continue asking questions until the problem is well-defined
- User can specify some questions to be answered later so that leave more room for brainstorming.
- Document all questions and answers in the brainstorming document

## 3. Zoom Out First Approach

- ALWAYS start with the widest possible view of the problem
- View the problem from a larger context to have a larger solution space.
- Then progressively zoom in layer by layer to go deeper into the problem.
- Each layer adds more detail and specificity
- Continue this zoom-out approach throughout the brainstorming session

## 4. Iterative Solution Thinking

- When exploring solutions, use an iterative approach, no need to come up with the perfect solution at once, just keep generating ideas and refining them.
- Generate multiple solution alternatives at each layer and write down the tradeoffs, the principles and the priorities of the solutions.
- Review and refine solutions before going deeper into implementation details
- Validate assumptions at each iteration
- Allow for backtracking when needed
- Build upon previous ideas and solutions at each layer

## 5. Documentation Requirements

- Write everything down to `.md` files for context preservation
- Document all layers of thinking from the widest view to implementation details
- Capture questions, answers, and decisions made at each step
- Maintain clear structure following the zoom-out approach
- Include diagrams, lists, and structured information as needed
- Each document files should range from 200-300 lines so that the agent and reader can easily understand the context and the solution.
- Since the brainstorming document is split into multiple files, should have links to refer to other files to make it easier to navigate. especially when talk about some stuff that is mentioned in other files.

## 6. Best Practices

- Focus on quantity of ideas initially before evaluating quality
- Withhold criticism during the idea generation phase
- Encourage wild and unconventional ideas at the early stages
- Build on each other's ideas (AI building on previous iterations)
- Set clear objectives and maintain focus on the problem statement
- Use visual aids when helpful (lists, hierarchies, flow diagrams)
