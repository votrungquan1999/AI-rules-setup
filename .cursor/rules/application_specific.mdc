# Context

A command-line tool that helps developers pull curated AI agent rules from a centralized repository into their projects. No more hunting through scattered rule files - get the exact rules you need for your tech stack with a simple command.

# Documents

- the design documents are in the root/docs folder
- the road map can also be found in the root/docs/roadmap.md file
- When requested to do some tasks, first check the design documents and the road map to see if the task is already in the road map or if there is a design document for it.

# Rules

## General Rules

- When changing content of the rule file for any AI agent, always update the corresponding rule file in the rules folder for other AI agents as well.

- When changing content of the rule file for an AI agent, should update the manifest.json file for the corresponding AI agent as well.

## Cursor Rules

- for each cursor rule file, must strictly be less than 200 lines of code. Preferably around 150 lines of code.
- should use the root/rules.md as master rule file and should follow it in all user requests.
- After editing around 5 files, should ask the user to review if the current direction is correct, then continue with the next 5 files.

## Testing Rules

- agent should never run test by itself. It should always be done by the user. then user can copy and past the test output to the agent.
