# Meta Rules

These rules MUST always be followed unless explicitly overridden.  
For each task, Cursor MUST double-check:

1. Which rules were applied.
2. Whether any relevant rules were missed.
3. If any rule conflicts exist, resolve them explicitly.

- ALWAYS explain which rules were applied in the output.
- MUST keep files under **300 lines** for AI context management.
- NEVER require running/building the server to validate output.
- NEVER run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` after completing tasks, the user will handle this.
- AI MAY replace entire components or structures if it improves clarity/compliance.
- For complex changes, AI MUST ask:
  - "Am I correct?"
  - "Which rules apply here?"
  - "Did I miss any relevant rules?"
