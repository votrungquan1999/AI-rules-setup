# Structured Brainstorming

This Skill provides a structured approach to brainstorming and problem-solving using the zoom-out-first methodology with iterative refinement.

## Core Methodology

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly state the problem at the top
2. **Clarification** - Ask questions before generating ideas
3. **Zoom Out First** - Start with the widest view, then progressively zoom in
4. **Iterate** - Generate multiple alternatives, refine, and build upon ideas
5. **Document Everything** - Write to .md files for context preservation

---

## Phase 1: Problem Definition

**Create a brainstorming document** (e.g., `brainstorm-[topic].md`)

**Include:**
- Clear problem statement at the top
- Current state and context
- Constraints and requirements
- Stakeholders and impact areas
- Initial hypotheses and potential solutions

**Document Structure:**
- Use markdown sections for organization
- Use markdown links to refer between sections for easy navigation
- Keep documents 200-300 lines for readability

---

## Phase 2: Clarification Through Questions

**MUST ask clarifying questions before generating ideas**

Questions to cover:
- **Scope**: What's in scope? What's out of scope?
- **Constraints**: Technical, time, resource, budget limitations?
- **Goals**: What defines success? What are we optimizing for?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we measure success?
- **Context**: What's the current situation? What led to this?
- **Stakeholders**: Who's affected? Who needs to approve?

**Important:**
- Continue asking until the problem is well-defined
- User can defer some questions to leave room for exploration
- Document all questions and answers in the brainstorming document

---

## Phase 3: Zoom Out First Approach

**ALWAYS start with the widest possible view**

### Layer 1: Highest Level (Widest View)
- View the problem from the largest context
- Consider the broader system, industry, or domain
- Identify high-level approaches and alternatives
- Document tradeoffs, principles, and priorities

### Layer 2: Zoom In One Level
- Break down chosen high-level approach
- Add more detail and specificity
- Generate multiple alternatives at this layer
- Review and refine before going deeper

### Layer 3: Continue Zooming In
- Progressively add implementation details
- Validate assumptions at each layer
- Allow for backtracking when needed
- Build upon previous ideas

**Continue this pattern until reaching implementation details**

---

## Phase 4: Iterative Solution Thinking

**No need for perfect solutions at once**

### Iteration Process:
1. **Generate** - Create multiple solution alternatives
2. **Document Tradeoffs** - Write pros/cons for each alternative
3. **Define Principles** - What principles guide this solution?
4. **Set Priorities** - What's most important?
5. **Review & Refine** - Improve the solution before going deeper
6. **Validate Assumptions** - Check if assumptions still hold
7. **Backtrack if Needed** - Don't be afraid to revisit earlier layers

### At Each Layer:
- Generate at least 2-3 alternatives
- Document the reasoning for each
- Identify which alternative to pursue
- Note why other alternatives were rejected
- Keep rejected alternatives for future reference

---

## Documentation Best Practices

### File Organization
- Create separate `.md` files for complex brainstorms
- Split into multiple files when a single file exceeds 300 lines
- Use descriptive filenames: `brainstorm-authentication-approach.md`
- Link between files using markdown links

### Content Structure
```markdown
# Problem Statement
Clear, concise problem statement

## Context
Current situation, background, what led here

## Constraints
- Technical constraints
- Time/resource constraints
- Business constraints

## Zoom Level 1: [Highest Level View]
### Alternative 1: [Approach Name]
**Pros:**
- ...

**Cons:**
- ...

**Principles:**
- ...

### Alternative 2: [Approach Name]
...

### Decision: Go with Alternative 1
**Reasoning:** ...

## Zoom Level 2: [One Level Deeper]
[Breaking down Alternative 1]
...
```

### Keep Documents Modular
- Each file: 200-300 lines for easy comprehension
- Cross-reference with markdown links
- Example: `For authentication details, see [auth-design.md](./auth-design.md)`

## Best Practices

### During Ideation
- ✅ Focus on quantity initially before quality
- ✅ Withhold criticism during idea generation
- ✅ Encourage wild and unconventional ideas
- ✅ Build on previous iterations
- ✅ Set clear objectives and maintain focus

### Visual Aids
When helpful, use:
- Lists for alternatives
- Hierarchies for system structure
- Flow diagrams for processes
- Tables for comparisons

### Examples
```markdown
## Authentication Alternatives Comparison

| Alternative | Security | Complexity | Cost | Time |
|-------------|----------|------------|------|------|
| OAuth 2.0   | High     | High       | Low  | 3w   |
| JWT Only    | Medium   | Low        | Low  | 1w   |
| Sessions    | High     | Medium     | Low  | 2w   |
```

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Help me brainstorm..."
- "I need to design..."
- "Let's explore options for..."
- "Help me think through..."
- "What are different ways to..."
- "I'm trying to figure out how to..."

**Good for:**
- System design and architecture
- Problem-solving and solution exploration
- Feature planning and approach selection
- Technical decision making
- Exploring implementation alternatives

**Not good for:**
- Quick code fixes (use directly)
- Well-defined implementation tasks (use feature-development-workflow)
- Simple questions with clear answers

---

## Summary Workflow

1. **Create brainstorming document**
2. **Define problem clearly** at the top
3. **Ask clarifying questions** until problem is well-understood
4. **Start zoomed out** - widest possible view
5. **Generate alternatives** at current zoom level
6. **Document tradeoffs, principles, priorities**
7. **Review and refine** solutions
8. **Zoom in one level** and repeat
9. **Iterate until reaching implementation details**
10. **Split into multiple files** if document exceeds 300 lines
11. **Use markdown links** to connect related documents

**Remember:** Start wide, zoom in progressively, iterate at each layer, document everything, and keep files modular for readability.
