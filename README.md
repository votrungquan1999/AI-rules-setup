# AI Rules CLI

A command-line tool that helps developers pull curated AI agent rules from a centralized repository into their projects. No more hunting through scattered rule files - get the exact rules you need for your tech stack with a simple command.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g ai-rules

# Initialize rules for your project
ai-rules init

# Add specific rule categories
ai-rules add typescript react

# Update to latest rules
ai-rules update
```

## What is AI Rules CLI?

AI Rules CLI solves the problem of scattered, hard-to-find AI agent rule files across different projects. Instead of manually copying rules from various sources, you can:

- **Discover** rules by tech stack using natural language search
- **Install** only the rules you need for your specific project
- **Update** to the latest rule versions with a single command
- **Refine** your selection through intelligent questioning

## Supported AI Agents

- **Cursor** - `.cursor/rules/` directory with `.cursorrules` files
- **Windsurf** - `.windsurf/rules/` directory with `.windsurfrules` files
- **More coming soon** - Aider, Continue, Cody, and others

## Key Features

### üéØ Smart Rule Discovery

Use natural language to find relevant rules:

```bash
ai-rules search "nextjs 15 server components tailwind"
```

### üîç Interactive Refinement

Get personalized recommendations through guided questions:

- "Are you using App Router or Pages Router?"
- "What's your primary data fetching strategy?"
- "Do you prefer Tailwind or styled-components?"

### üì¶ Easy Management

```bash
# See what's installed
ai-rules status

# Add more rules
ai-rules add nextjs database

# Remove unused rules
ai-rules remove old-framework

# Update everything
ai-rules update
```

## How It Works

1. **Initialize** - Choose your AI agent and tech stack
2. **Discover** - Search for relevant rules using natural language
3. **Refine** - Answer questions to get personalized recommendations
4. **Install** - Rules are automatically placed in the correct locations
5. **Update** - Keep your rules current with the latest versions

## Configuration

The CLI creates a `.ai-rules.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "agent": "cursor",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "typescript-strict",
      "category": "typescript",
      "installedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "source": "github.com/your-org/ai-rules"
    }
  ],
  "preferences": {
    "autoUpdate": false,
    "conflictResolution": "prompt"
  }
}
```

## Commands

### `ai-rules init`

Interactive setup wizard that guides you through:

- AI agent selection
- Tech stack identification
- Rule discovery and selection
- Installation configuration

### `ai-rules add <categories...>`

Add specific rule categories to your project:

```bash
ai-rules add typescript react nextjs
```

### `ai-rules remove <categories...>`

Remove rule categories from your project:
