# AI Rules CLI - Iterative Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the iterative development strategy for the AI Rules CLI project. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, adding measurable value while maintaining a working product at all times.

## Development Principles

- **MVP First**: Start with the bare minimum viable product
- **Iterative Enhancement**: Each iteration adds clear value
- **User Feedback Driven**: Incorporate feedback between iterations
- **Maintainable**: Keep code clean and well-documented
- **Extensible**: Design for future growth

## Iteration Timeline

| --------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1         | MVP with Cursor support        | Completed |
| 2         | Expand Cursor rule library     | Completed |
| 3         | Web UI for Rule Selection      | Completed |
| 4         | Cache Revalidation             | Completed |
| 5         | Enhanced Commands              | Planned   |
| 6         | Semantic search with vector DB | Planned   |
| 7         | Interactive rule refinement    | Planned   |
| 8         | Community Expansion            | Planned   |
| 9         | Multi-tool support             | Planned   |

- [x] Implementation: GitHub Actions workflow

**Purpose**: Quick implementation to ensure the web UI reflects rule changes immediately without manual intervention.

### Success Criteria

- [x] Rule changes trigger cache revalidation automatically

### Deliverables

- Cache revalidation mechanism (GitHub Actions + TypeScript script)
- Basic documentation (inline workflow comments)

---

## Iteration 5: Enhanced Commands

**Goal**: Improve CLI usability and safety

### Features

- [ ] Add commands for managing individual categories (add, remove, list)
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution when files already exist
- [ ] Add validation to prevent common errors
- [ ] Improve user feedback and experience

**Purpose**: Make the CLI more flexible and user-friendly for managing rules after initial setup.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can manage rules without re-running init
- [ ] Conflicts are handled gracefully

### Deliverables

- Enhanced CLI commands
- Conflict resolution system
- Improved validation

---

## Iteration 6: Semantic Search with Vector DB

**Goal**: Enable natural language rule discovery

### Features

- [ ] Integrate vector database for semantic search
- [ ] Support natural language queries
- [ ] Return ranked results based on similarity
- [ ] Provide fallback to keyword search when needed

**Purpose**: Allow users to find relevant rules using natural language instead of browsing categories.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can search with natural language queries
- [ ] Results are relevant and properly ranked

### Deliverables

- Vector database integration
- Search functionality
- Documentation

---

## Iteration 7: Interactive Rule Refinement

**Goal**: Improve rule selection accuracy through guided questions

### Features

- [ ] Ask clarifying questions after search
- [ ] Narrow down results based on user answers
- [ ] Save preferences for future use
- [ ] Support iterative refinement

**Purpose**: Help users select the most relevant rules by asking context-specific questions about their tech stack and preferences.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Questions effectively narrow down rule selection
- [ ] Process is intuitive and quick

### Deliverables

- Question system
- Refinement flow
- Preference storage

---

## Iteration 8: Community Expansion

**Goal**: Enable community contributions through web interface

### Features

- [ ] Web-based rule editor with markdown preview
- [ ] Direct PR submission to GitHub from UI
- [ ] Community features (reviews, ratings, examples)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for rule usage
- [ ] Public API for programmatic access

**Purpose**: Lower the barrier for community contributions and grow the rule library through collaborative efforts.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Non-technical users can contribute rules
- [ ] Submission process is streamlined and intuitive

### Deliverables

- Rule editor interface
- GitHub integration
- Community features
- Analytics dashboard
- Public API

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Vector DB Performance**: Start with local LanceDB, add cloud support later
- **GitHub API Limits**: Implement caching and rate limiting
- **File System Issues**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

### Product Risks

- **User Adoption**: Focus on developer experience and clear value proposition
- **Rule Quality**: Establish quality guidelines and review process
- **Community Growth**: Provide clear contribution guidelines and templates

### Timeline Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to iteration goals, defer nice-to-have features
- **Technical Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity iteratively
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies, have fallbacks

## Post-Iteration 10

### Future Considerations

- **Machine Learning**: Learn from usage patterns to improve recommendations
- **Enterprise Features**: Team management, private rule repositories
- **Mobile Support**: CLI tools for mobile development
- **IDE Integration**: Direct integration with popular IDEs
- **Rule Marketplace**: Community-driven rule sharing and monetization

### Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Keep rules current with technology changes
- **Community Support**: Maintain active community engagement
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous improvement of search and discovery
