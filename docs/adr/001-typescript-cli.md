# ADR-001: TypeScript + Commander.js for CLI Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose the technology stack for building the AI Rules CLI tool. The CLI needs to be:

- Easy to publish to NPM
- Cross-platform compatible
- Maintainable and type-safe
- Fast to develop and iterate on

## Decision

We will use **TypeScript** as the primary language with **Commander.js** as the CLI framework.

## Rationale

### TypeScript Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Catches errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify code over time
- **NPM Ecosystem**: Full access to the JavaScript/Node.js package ecosystem
- **Team Familiarity**: Most developers are familiar with TypeScript

### Commander.js Benefits

- **Mature and Stable**: Battle-tested in many production CLIs
- **Simple API**: Easy to learn and use for basic CLI needs
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript definitions
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and bundle size
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new commands and features

### Alternative Considered: oclif

**Pros:**

- More features out of the box (plugins, testing utilities)
- Better for complex CLIs with many commands
- Built-in help generation and documentation

**Cons:**

- Heavier dependency (~5MB vs ~1MB for Commander)
- Steeper learning curve
- Overkill for our initial scope
- More opinionated structure

### Alternative Considered: Go/Rust

**Pros:**

- Single binary distribution
- Faster startup times
- No runtime dependencies

**Cons:**

- Harder to publish to NPM (requires wrappers)
- Less familiar to JavaScript developers
- Longer development time
- Overkill for file copying operations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fast development and iteration
- Easy NPM publishing with `npx ai-rules`
- Type safety reduces bugs
- Familiar tooling for JavaScript developers
- Easy to find contributors

### Negative

- Requires Node.js runtime (but this is acceptable for our target audience)
- Larger bundle size than compiled languages
- Slower startup than native binaries (but acceptable for our use case)

## Implementation Notes

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang in entry file
- Configure `bin` field in package.json
- Compile TypeScript to `dist/` directory
- Include only `dist/` in NPM package
